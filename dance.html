    <h1>Bollywood Dance Class:</h1>
      <p>The term ‘Bollywood’ comes from the combination of the names of Bombay (now known as Mumbai) and Hollywood. The Bollywood film industry, based in Mumbai, is the largest film industry in the world in terms of ticket sales and the amount of films made per year.Bollywood films are mostly musicals with very few movies made without at least one song and dance sequence.</p>
      
      <p>We believe "Bollywood" is not just one specific style of dance, but a collage of many dance styles set to chart-topping Bollywood songs. Traditionally, Bollywood dance has been associated with the 'hip-shaking', 'light-bulb twisting' types of moves.</p>

      <p>We use the best songs from the film industry, Each song has it's own feel and vibe. We create routines which are connected and appropriate to truly interpret each song.</p>
